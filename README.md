# Sprints

Sprints is a Ruby on Rails application to help groups stay on task. 

Within this application, a user can create a project, add tasks (or sprints) to that project, and add fellow users. Other members of the project can add their own sprints. Once a sprint is completed by any member, all members of the group will see that sprint cleared from the list.

This functionality is made possible by many to many queries.
